# among-us
Among us server implemented in Python.

### Where can I find the client?
This repository is just the server, `client.html` is used to test it without the real client.
You can find the client in [https://github.com/Vulkz/among-us.github.io](https://github.com/Vulkz/among-us.github.io).

### Why two repositories?
I (NiumXp) am ~~trying~~ to teach [Vulkz](https://github.com/Vulkz) about how internet, servers, etc... work. And creating these projects can be very helpful.
